# alphabet_guess
A fun and simple terminal-based Python game where you try to guess the secret letter chosen by the computer from A to Z.

🎮 How It Works
- The computer randomly picks a lowercase letter (a–z).
- You guess the letter by typing in the terminal.
- If your guess is wrong, the game gives you a hint:
- Whether the secret letter comes before or after your guess.
- The game keeps track of how many attempts you take.
- You can type exit at any time to quit.
